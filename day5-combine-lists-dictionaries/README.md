# 30-Day Python Challenge: Day 5

## Day 5: Combining Lists and Dictionaries in Python

**Objective:** Today's focus is on working with tasks that combine both lists and dictionaries in Python, building on the understanding of advanced list and dictionary operations from the previous days.

### Prompt Used for GPT to Generate Content
Hello, ChatGPT! Today is Day 5 of my 30-day Python learning challenge, and according to my learning plan, I should be working on tasks combining both lists and dictionaries. Can you provide me with a detailed explanation of this topic, some examples, and a few exercises to help me practice and understand the concept better? I have two hours to dedicate to this study session. Thank you!

### Description:

On Day 5, we're combining our knowledge of lists and dictionaries to tackle tasks that involve both data structures. This will help us understand how to effectively use them together to solve more complex problems in Python.

As usual, we interacted with ChatGPT, asking for explanations, examples, and exercises to help us practice and understand tasks that combine lists and dictionaries. This hands-on approach allowed us to explore and solve several real-world challenges involving both data structures.

### Files:

1. `day5_explanation.md`: Contains the explanation provided by ChatGPT on tasks combining both lists and dictionaries.
2. `day5_exercises.md`: Contains practice exercises on tasks combining both lists and dictionaries provided by ChatGPT along with our solutions.
3. `day5_practice.py`: My practice sheet for the exercises.

### Key Learnings:

- Understanding how to combine lists and dictionaries in Python.
- Writing Python code to solve problems involving both lists and dictionaries.
- Practicing and applying the concepts in real-world scenarios.

Stay tuned for Day 6, where we will review and self-assess our understanding of list and dictionary operations in Python!
