**Exercises**

1. Create a list comprehension that generates the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use a list comprehension to create a new list of the cubes of the numbers from 1 to 10, but only if the cube is evenly divisible by 4.
3. Given the list `names = ['Nick', 'Alice', 'Kitty', 'Lionel', 'Daisy']`, create a list comprehension that generates a new list containing only the names that start with an 'L'.
4. Use a list comprehension to create a list of all the years from 1900 to 2100 that are leap years. (Hint: a leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400).

These exercises should give you a good sense of how list comprehensions work. Feel free to ask if you need any help or explanations!
