# 30-Day Python Challenge with ChatGPT

Welcome to the repository of my 30-day Python learning journey! In this challenge, I'm learning Python with the help of an AI language model developed by OpenAI, called ChatGPT. 

This repository contains all the code snippets, exercises, and projects that I'll be working on during these 30 days. 

## Structure

The repository is organized by day. Each day has its own folder, which includes:

- A Python file for the code written that day
- A text file with a brief summary of what was learned

## How to Navigate

To navigate through the repository, simply click on the folder for the day you're interested in. Inside, you'll find the Python file and the summary text file.

## More Information

For more details about each day's learning progress, check out my YouTube channel [Zack Langford Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecbZBlKqRKx19zwoW9gm0A). I post daily videos documenting my learning journey, my interactions with ChatGPT, and how I'm improving my Python skills.
