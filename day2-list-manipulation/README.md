# 30-Day Python Challenge: Day 2

## Day 2: Complex List Manipulation Tasks

**Objective:** Today's focus is on tackling complex list manipulation tasks in Python, building on the understanding of list comprehensions from Day 1.

### Prompt Used for GPT to Generate Content
Hello, ChatGPT! Today is Day 2 of my 30-day Python learning challenge, and according to my learning plan, I should be studying complex list manipulation tasks. Can you provide me with a detailed explanation of this topic, some examples, and a few exercises to help me practice and understand the concept better? I have two hours to dedicate to this study session. Thank you!

### Description:

Building on our knowledge from Day 1, we're moving into more complex territory with list manipulation tasks in Python. These tasks require a deeper understanding of list operations and how to effectively use them to solve real-world problems.

As always, we interacted with ChatGPT, asking for explanations, examples, and exercises to help us practice and understand this concept. Through this, we were able to tackle and solve several complex list manipulation tasks.

### Files:

1. `complex_list_manipulation_explanation.md`: Contains the explanation provided by ChatGPT on complex list manipulation tasks.
2. `complex_list_manipulation_exercises.md`: Contains practice exercises on complex list manipulation tasks provided by ChatGPT along with our solutions.
3. `day2_practice.py`: My practice sheet for the exercises.

### Key Learnings:

- Understanding complex list manipulation tasks in Python.
- Writing Python code to solve complex list manipulation problems.
- Practicing and applying complex list manipulations.

Stay tuned for Day 3 where we will start studying dictionary operations in Python!
