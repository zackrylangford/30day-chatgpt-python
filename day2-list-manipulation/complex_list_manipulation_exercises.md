Here are some exercises to help you practice:

1. **Nested List Comprehension**: Given a matrix (a list of lists) of numbers, create a list comprehension that flattens the matrix into a single list.

2. **List Comprehension with Conditional Logic**: Given a list of numbers, create a list comprehension that generates a new list that contains "Positive", "Negative" or "Zero" based on each number in the original list.

3. **List Slicing**: Given a list of numbers, create a new list that contains only the last 3 elements of the original list.

4. **List Operations**: Given a list of numbers, write a Python program that inserts a new number at the second position in the list and removes the last element from the list. 

Remember to spend time understanding each concept and task before moving on to the next one. You're doing great! Keep up the good work.
