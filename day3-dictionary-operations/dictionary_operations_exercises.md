Now, let's try some exercises to practice these concepts:

1. Create a dictionary representing a student. The dictionary should include keys for 'name', 'age', 'grade', and 'subjects'

2. Given a dictionary `{'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}`, write a Python script to swap keys and values, i.e., you should end up with `{'1': 'A', '2': 'B', '3': 'C'}`.

3. Write a Python program to remove a key from a dictionary. Try to remove a key that does not exist and use the `dict.pop()` method with a default value to prevent a `KeyError`.

4. Given two lists `keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']` and `values = [1, 2, 3]`, create a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the `keys` list, and the values are the elements from the `values` list. Your resulting dictionary should look like `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`.

5. Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are the square of the keys.

6. Given a dictionary, write a Python program to filter out keys from the dictionary. Your program should filter out keys with the value 'None'.

7. Given a string, count how many times each character appears in the string. Store this data in a dictionary.

8. Given a dictionary, write a Python program to create a list for all the keys, and another list for all the values of the dictionary.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Try to solve these problems by yourself, and let me know if you need any help.
