# 30-Day Python Challenge: Day 3

## Day 3: Dictionary Operations in Python

**Objective:** Today's focus is on studying dictionary operations in Python, building on the understanding of complex list manipulation tasks from Days 1 and 2.

### Prompt Used for GPT to Generate Content
Hello, ChatGPT! Today is Day 3 of my 30-day Python learning challenge, and according to my learning plan, I should be studying dictionary operations. Can you provide me with a detailed explanation of this topic, some examples, and a few exercises to help me practice and understand the concept better? I have two hours to dedicate to this study session. Thank you!

### Description:

On the third day of our journey, we're shifting our focus to Python dictionaries. Just like lists, dictionaries are another fundamental data type in Python that allow us to store and manipulate data in a different and often more efficient way.

As per our practice, we interacted with ChatGPT, asking for explanations, examples, and exercises to help us practice and understand dictionary operations. This hands-on approach helped us explore and understand dictionary operations in depth.

### Files:

1. `dictionary_operations_explanation.md`: Contains the explanation provided by ChatGPT on dictionary operations.
2. `dictionary_operations_exercises.md`: Contains practice exercises on dictionary operations provided by ChatGPT along with our solutions.
3. `day3_practice.py`: My practice sheet for the exercises.

### Key Learnings:

- Understanding dictionary operations in Python.
- Writing Python code to perform various dictionary operations.
- Practicing and applying dictionary operations in real-world scenarios.

Stay tuned for Day 4 where we will dive deeper into more complex dictionary tasks in Python!
