Hello! Great to see your progress. Today, we'll work on more complex dictionary tasks, focusing on nested dictionaries, dictionary comprehensions, and operations with multiple dictionaries.

**Nested Dictionaries:**
A dictionary can have other dictionaries as values, forming nested dictionaries. This can be useful for organizing data with multiple levels of hierarchy.

Example:
```python
contacts = {
    'Alice': {
        'phone': '555-1234',
        'email': 'alice@example.com'
    },
    'Bob': {
        'phone': '555-5678',
        'email': 'bob@example.com'
    }
}
```

**Dictionary Comprehensions:**
Dictionary comprehensions are similar to list comprehensions, but they create dictionaries instead of lists. Dictionary comprehensions use curly braces `{}` and consist of a key-value pair, followed by a `for` clause and an optional `if` clause.

Example:
```python
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
```
This dictionary comprehension generates a dictionary with keys from 1 to 5, and values as their squares.

**Operations with Multiple Dictionaries:**
You can perform various operations with multiple dictionaries, such as merging them, comparing keys, or updating values.

Example (merging dictionaries):
```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
merged = {**dict1, **dict2}
```
In this example, the `merged` dictionary will contain the merged content of `dict1` and `dict2`, with values from `dict2` taking precedence.
