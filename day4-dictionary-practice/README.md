# 30-Day Python Challenge: Day 4

## Day 4: Complex Dictionary Tasks in Python

**Objective:** Today's focus is on tackling complex dictionary tasks in Python, building on the understanding of dictionary operations from Day 3. We're following our learning plan for Week 1, which focuses on Advanced List and Dictionary Operations.

### Prompt Used for GPT to Generate Content
Hello, ChatGPT! Today is Day 4 of my 30-day Python learning challenge, and according to my learning plan, I should be working on more complex dictionary tasks. Can you provide me with a detailed explanation of this topic, some examples, and a few exercises to help me practice and understand the concept better? I have two hours to dedicate to this study session. Thank you!

### Description:

On Day 4, we're diving deeper into complex dictionary tasks in Python, building on our knowledge from the previous days. These tasks require a deeper understanding of dictionaries and their operations, and how to effectively use them to solve real-world problems.

As always, we interacted with ChatGPT, asking for explanations, examples, and exercises to help us practice and understand complex dictionary tasks. Through this, we were able to tackle and solve several challenging dictionary tasks.

### Files:

1. `complex_dictionary_tasks_explanation.md`: Contains the explanation provided by ChatGPT on complex dictionary tasks.
2. `complex_dictionary_tasks_exercises.md`: Contains practice exercises on complex dictionary tasks provided by ChatGPT along with our solutions.
3. `day4_practice.py`: My practice sheet for the exercises.

### Key Learnings:

- Understanding complex dictionary tasks in Python.
- Writing Python code to solve complex dictionary problems.
- Practicing and applying complex dictionary operations in real-world scenarios.

Stay tuned for Day 5, where we will work on tasks combining both lists and dictionaries in Python!
