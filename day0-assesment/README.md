# Assessment

This folder contains the initial Python skills assessment that was created by ChatGPT to evaluate my current Python knowledge at the start of the 30-day challenge.

Inside, you will find:

- The markdown file `assessment.md` contains the questions that ChatGPT come up with for my assesment
- The `my_answers.py` file contains my attempts at answering the questions.
- A markdown file `assessment_summary.md` providing a brief summary of the assessment, my performance, and the learning plan suggested by ChatGPT based on my strengths and weaknesses.
- A markdown file `learning_plan.md` which is the suggested learning plan that GPT provided after the assessment.

This assessment served as the starting point of my Python learning journey, helping to tailor the subsequent learning process to my specific needs and skill level.

## Prompt Used to Generate the Assessment

Here is the prompt that I used to generate the assessment and kickstart the challenge: 

Hello, ChatGPT! I am about to embark on a 30-day Python learning challenge, and I need your help to guide me through it. My goal is to significantly improve my Python skills over the course of the next month.

Today is Day 0, and we'll start with an assessment to understand my current level of Python knowledge. Based on this, I would like you to tailor a learning plan for me.

From Day 1 to Day 30, I will be dedicating two hours each day to learn Python under your guidance. I want this challenge to be comprehensive, covering a range of topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

Please take into account that I would like to document this journey, including our interactions and the lessons you provide, in a public GitHub repository and a series of YouTube videos. This means that your responses should be clear, concise, and easily understandable for those who might be following along.

Let's kick off this journey with the assessment. Can you generate a Python skills assessment for me?
