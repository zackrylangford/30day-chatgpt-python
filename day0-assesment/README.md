# Assessment

This folder contains the initial Python skills assessment that was created by ChatGPT to evaluate my current Python knowledge at the start of the 30-day challenge.

Inside, you will find:

- The Python file `assessment.py` containing the questions and my solutions.
- A text file `assessment_summary.md` providing a brief summary of the assessment, my performance, and the learning plan suggested by ChatGPT based on my strengths and weaknesses.

This assessment served as the starting point of my Python learning journey, helping to tailor the subsequent learning process to my specific needs and skill level.
