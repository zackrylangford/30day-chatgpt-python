Absolutely, I'd be delighted to assist you in your Python learning journey! Let's start with an initial assessment to understand your current level of knowledge. Please attempt the following questions:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Write a Python program to add two user-provided numbers.

2. **Control Flow/Loops**: Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to n, where n is a user input.

3. **Lists**: Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

4. **Dictionaries**: Given a dictionary, write a Python function that inverts the keys and values of the dictionary (i.e., keys become values and values become keys).

5. **Functions**: Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.

6. **File Handling**: Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list.

7. **Error Handling**: Write a Python function that takes two integers as input and returns their division. Your function should handle the case when the second integer is zero by printing an appropriate message.

8. **Classes and Objects**: Define a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods that will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.

9. **Decorators**: Explain what decorators are in Python and write a simple decorator function.

10. **Modules and Packages**: Write a Python script to import a module and use a function that you've defined in it.

Please remember, the goal is not to rush but to understand where you currently stand with your Python knowledge. Take your time, and when you're ready, share your responses. This will help me better tailor the learning plan for you.
